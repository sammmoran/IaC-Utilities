# As a rule, it's almost always a good idea to include outputs as part of your Terraform deployment, when you run "terraform apply".
# These outputs can provide clarity as to the success/failure of our deployed resources. 
# Terraform will construct certain components in our other files (i.e. the IAM policies/roles/profiles, the security groups, etc.) in sequential fashion and this will provide visibility as that process goes.
