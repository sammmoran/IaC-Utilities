# IaC-Utilities

Welcome to the Infrastructure-as-Code (IAC) Utilities repository! This repository will enable you to leverage the Cloud to quickly provision modern Windows servers (complete with installed disassemblers, hex editors, and a host of other malware anlaysis tools) for malware analysis. It also enables quick access to DropBox for file storage and retrieval. The overall goal: give you quick-access to malware analysis tooling for learning and discovery.
